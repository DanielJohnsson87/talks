- `Reducers` should **only** depend on `state` and `action` to calculate new `state`.
- `Reducers` must not use asynchronous logic. (`AJAX calls`, `timeouts`, `promises`).
- `Reducers` must not  generate random values (`Date.now()`, `Math.random()).
- `Reducers` must not modify variables outside the `reducer`.
- `Reducers` must not run code that affects things outside of the `reducer`.
