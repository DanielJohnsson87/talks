Because of the way Redux forces you to structure your code, testing becomes much easier. You can even let ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot do the work for you.

```javascript
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
// Other code left our for the sake of the example.
const store = configureStore(/*...*/);

it("should add vehicles to the list", () => {
	const vehicleCount = vehicleCountSelector(store.getState());
    expect(vehicleCount).toEqual(0);
    
    // Add vehicle
    store.dispatch(vehicleAdded({id: 1, name: "Vehicle 1"}));
	
	// Assert
	const newVehicleCount = vehicleCountSelector(store.getState());
    expect(newVehicleCount).toEqual(1);
  });

```
