- Pattern where you calculate the current `state` based on all `events` that happened in the past. 
- When properly applied you are able to travel back in time to any given moment and calculate what the `state` was at that point. 
- Redux is not event sourced, but there are some similarities. 
	- Like: Only allowing `events` to modify the `state`. With Redux DevTools the entire `event` log is visible and traceable.
