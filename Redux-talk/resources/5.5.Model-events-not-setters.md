# 5.5 👩‍🎨 Model actions as events, not setters.

- Treat actions more as "describing events that occurred", rather than "setters".
- Treating actions as "events" generally leads to:
	- More meaningful `action` names
	- Fewer total actions being dispatched
	- And a more meaningful `action` log history. 
- Writing "setters" often results in too many individual `action` types, too many dispatches, and an `action` log that is less meaningful.
