- Prefer calculating new `state` in `reducers` rather then in code that prepares and dispatches `actions`.  (Like a click handler)
	- It helps ensure that more of the actual app logic is easily testable.
	- Enables more effective use of time-travel debugging.
	- Helps avoid common mistakes that can lead to mutations and bugs
- There are cases where calculating state outside of `reducers` is valid, like generating unique ID's.
