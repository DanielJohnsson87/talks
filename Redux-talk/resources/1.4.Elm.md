# 1.4 👩‍🎤 Elm

- Elm is a functional programming language inspired by Haskell. 
- It enforces a “model view update” architecture, Elms “updaters” serve the same purpose as `reducers` in Redux.
- Redux actually recommends you to read about the Elm architecture and says it will look there for inspiration.
